        <h1>CRUDable REST API</h1>
        <h2 id="crud-exp">Explained</h2>
        <p>
            We talked about setting up a full CRUDable REST API over the last few weeks and it all culminated in an assignment we had for drinks.
            For this we should know conventions, and be able to build it in express. The conventions goes as follows:
        </p>
        <li>Use the appropriate HTTP method for the action.</li>
        <li>Correct ordering of the HTTP methods.</li>
        <li>Naming the endpoints so that they map to the collection in the system.</li>
        <p>
            And this would be an example of how to the endpoints we should set up for it.
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/images/restapi.png">
        <h2 id="crud-ex">Example</h2>
        <p>
            So for an example all we need to do to set this up is, import express. Instantiate express. Set up a PORT for express. Enable body parsing
            so we can use post requests. And set up all of the routes as per the REST API conventions. These are the following collapsed routes.
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/images/restapi2.png">
        <p>
            The other notable things to add here from inside the collapsed routes, would be <span class="code">req.params.'nameOfParam'</span>, which could be id for example.
            We can then use that id to find the id in our array(which we used instead of a db).
        </p>
        <p>
            The other notable part is <span class="code">req.body</span> which we use to retrieve the body for a post/put/patch. For this instance it was
            fine to look at patch like put as per the industry most people just use put and never implement a patch for their API's. Put replaces the
            entire resource, while patch updates part of the resource. Personally i don't mind either way of setting it up, if i'm in a group i'll let
            other decide on points like that.
        </p>

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <h2 id="js-date">Date in JS</h2>
        <p>
            We had a big focus on the date object in JavaScript, followed by a small assignment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For date there is some no tables things to go over.
        </p>
        <p><span class="code">new Date()</span> this will provide us with UTC datetime.</p>
        <p><span class="code">Date().now</span> this will provide us with Unix Epoch Time (Seconds since 1970 Jan. 1st).</p>
        <p><span class="code">Date()</span> this will provide us with Central European Standard Time - CEST / GMT+1 - Localtime right here right now.</p>
        <p>
            Then we talked about months in JavaScript. For months we had 2 solutions we created for finding the current month.
        </p>
        <p><span class="code">const currentMonth = new Date().toLocaleString('en-us', { month: 'long' });</span></p>
        <p>
            This is a solution for finding the current month in english. The other solution is creating a months array and using that for months.
            We were told both solutions are equally correct even though i find it less time consuming to write the toLocateString version. Which is
            what i would prefer to use myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we talked about days which is a bit odd in JavaScript. It starts on Sunday so the index 0 is Sunday and then index 1 is Monday.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this we talked about date object containing time aswell, second, hours etc. We then created an assignment. I created the assignment
            which was a time untill death calender, with options for smoking, fast food etc. reducing your life span and dynamically updating your
            time left to live.
        </p>

        <h1>Fetch</h1>
        <h2 id="fetch-exp">Explained</h2>
        <p>
            We talked about fetch in JavaScript. For fetch we just need to be able to write it without hesitation, which is not the worst. Later it will 
            be explained in full when we break down asynchronous functions in JavaScript and write our own simulations of fetch.
        </p>
        <p>
            For fetch we need to write <span class="code">fetch</span> follow by <span class="code">(`www.example.com/placeToFetchFrom`)</span>.
            We then follow it by <span class="code">(response => response.json())</span>. This first .then handles the data we recieve and 
            parse it as json. That is then followed by a second <span class="code">.then(result => "something" = result.data)</span> it recieves the data
            from the previous one and we can here use it for "something" we need to do with it. If we keep using data as our responses from our
            REST API we can always follow this convention of using .data which is commonly used.
        </p>

        <h1>Deployment</h1>
        <h2 id="dep-exp">Explained</h2>
        <p>
            We talked about deployment where we used Vercel.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can easily create an account on Vercel with google, and link out github to Vercel. The last step is that we need a vercel.json file in our
            project that contains the information which Vercel needs. I have an example of the one i used for our Time project here.
        </p>
        <img src="../../assets/images/vercel.png">
        <p>
            We also had the option to use github pages, but i had never used Vercel before so i saw it as an opportunity to learn something new, as i
            had used github pages many times before.
