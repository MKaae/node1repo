        <h1>Git</h1>
        <h2 id="git-commands">Commands</h2>
        <li><span class="commands">git init</span></li>
        <p>
            This command is used to initiate git on a project. It does this by creating a .git in a sub directory.<br>
            You can only run this command if there isn't already a .git file. And be sure you're int the root of the directory you want
            to run this command on.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git add -A</span></li>
        <p>
            This command will stage all the changes in the entire repository where you're using it.<br>
            This will stage through the entire repository you're using in it, unlike ".", that just does it in the current directiory,
            and all directories below it. Resulting in -A being more effecient if you have changes across multiple directories.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git commit -m "message"</span></li>
        <p>
            When using this command we commit all the changes we have staged, and adds it to our local history as a new commit.<br>
            This means we can track our changes. Also the -m stands for message which is the message we add to the commit.<br>
            We want to have a clear message, a friend of mine told me "The action that it does", for instance,
            "adds eventlisteners to the homepage".
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git push origin main</span></li>
        <p>
            This pushes the changes to the main branch of the project that we have added to our git. "origin" is the name,
            that git has given the repository that we cloned from. "main" is the branch, and "push" is the command.
            This means we can also push to other remote branches like this. We did this alot in our "greenplate" project in 3rd semester. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git checkout -b branchname</span></li>
        <p>
            This command creates and checks us into the new branch that we just created. We haven't used it alot this semester,
            but we did use it the entirety of last semester during projects. "checkout" checks us into a branch, or you can say switches
            branches. "-b" is how you create a new branch.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git remote add origin githublinkToRepository</span></li>
        <p>
            This commands lets us add a remote to our repository. If we have already created a repository on github,
            and wants to add a connection to it, we can use this command. Github also provides us with this command after creating
            a new repository. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git branch -M main</span></li>
        <p>
           This renames the current branch to main. We use this before pushing to our github repository so we push with main branch,
           the first time we push our project.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git push -u origin main</span></li>
        <p>
            This pushing to our main to origin remote connection we made. We use -u to set up tracking so in the future we technically
            don't have to write git push origin main, because it will always push to main. But i personally find it good practice to do so,
            anwyays no matter where you are pushing to.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git pull origin main</span></li>
        <p>
            This fetches the changes from the origin remote connection we have and adds them to our local git. For example if we make any changes
            online, or if someone else does if multiple is working on it. We can't just push to main branch unless we pull the current
            changes beforehand. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git status</span></li>
        <p>
            Shows the log and status of our git. This can be useful if you make a mistake and get behind / ahead of head to see what
            is going on and what you should do to fix this. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There is a few more commands we use but they are all situational so not listing them here, as i don't see it as a part of the assignment,
            but these are the most useful ones i use on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <h2 id="git-exp">Explained</h2>
        <p>
            Small explenations of some of the reasons to use git.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use git for several reasons. Git make it easy to version things, as we can keep track of when, and what is going on. It also 
            helps us to look at who is doing what. We can see who commits things and when it's done. This also helps when on bigger projects we use 
            review as part of doing git commits, so before we merge anything, we have other people view our code, resulting in higher quality. We
            can also revert to previous commit if things break, or we can see when it actually broke.
        </p>

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <h2 id="js-datatypes">Data types, variables</h2>
        <h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>
            We went over template literals with strings, and how we can use them for string interpolation.
            We do this with `some text ${content}` to create a string with some text following by the string.<br>
            Example: 
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const firstName = "Anders";</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const lastName = "Latif";</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const fullName = `My first name is ${firstName} and my last name is ${lastName}`;</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">console.log(fullName);</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">My first name is Anders and my last name is Latif</span></li>
        <h3>Numbers</h3>
        <p>
            We also talked about how number and strings mixed can be a little wierd in js. We had an example of a string being a year 
            for example "2023" and then adding an increment of 1 to it. To do this we can just parseInt(year) or use Number(year) to parse 
            the string into the type we want it to have.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const year = "2023";</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const increment = 1;</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const newYear = Number(year)+increment;</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">console.log(newYear)</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">2024</span></li>
        <h3>Floats</h3>
        <p>
            We had several examples of floats. First was using parseFloat to change a string to a float and adding the numbers.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const numberOne = "1.10";</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const numberTwo = "2.30";</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const newNumber = parseFloat(numberOne)+parseFloat(numberTwo);</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">console.log(newNumber)</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">3.40</span></li>
        <p>
            We could do the same example as before with using Number instead. We can do this with using toFixed(2), which will result in 2 decimals.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const newNumber = (Number(numberOne)+Number(numberTwo).toFixed(2));</span></li>
        <p>
            We then worked with averages. We added several numbers and then took the average of them with decimals.
            We do this with simple math just adding them together and dividing with amount and using toFixed(5) for 5 decimals.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const numberOne = 10;</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const numberTwo = 45;</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const numberThree = 98;</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const newNumber = ((numberOne + numberTwo + numberThree) / 3).toFixed(5);</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">console.log(newNumber)</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">51.00000</span></li>
        <h3>Characters</h3>
        <p>
            We then worked with getting the 3rd / last character by index. There is several ways to solve this problems including string[number],
            string.substring(2,3), string.slice(2,3), and what i prefer string.chatAr(string.length-1) as i find this and substring close
            to what i have done in other languages, and length-1 seems like a more natural way to find last character.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const letters = "abc";</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const newLetter = letters.chatAr(letters.length-1);</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">console.log(newLetter);</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">c</span></li>
        <h3>Replace</h3>
        <p>
            We talked about replace and how it replaces letters in a string. During this i made a regex, but found out by doing that, that regex
            is slow in JavaScript and is not to be recommended.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const fact = "You are learning javascript";</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const newFact = fact.replace("j", "J");</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">console.log(newFact);</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">You are learning Javascript</span></li>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>
            We talked about objects we also talked about how to use them. You can console.log(object.key) but we talked about if we need to use
            the value you get in the future it's better to reassign it. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const myObject = { message: "Hello, earling! I bring peace."};</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const message = myObject.message;</span></li>
        <p>
            We talked about creating a new key value pair. Adding isAllowed and set it to true.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const stackOverflow = { };</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">stackOverflow.isAllowed = true;</span></li>
        <p>
            We talked about removing properties from objects and the correct way of doing so. We do this with the keyword delete.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const thisSong = { description: "This best song in the world." };</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">delete thisSong.description;</span></li>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>
            Under arrays we talked about getting array content by index. For instance getting a in the following scenario.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const letters = ["a", "b", "c"];</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">const letterKey = letters[1];</span></li>
        <p>
            How to easily insert items into an array. We do this with splice, where we first chose
            the position and secondly chose for example 0 if we don't want to remove any elements from the array. This
            is because splice takes 2 arguments. This example will insert the 3 statements after cucumber and not remove anything.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const diet = ["tomate", "cucumber", "rocket"];</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">diet.splice(2, 0, "hamburger", "soda", "pizza");</span></li>
        <p>
            How to add an element to the end, and how to remove the last element. push() and pop(). 
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">diet.push("This");</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">diet.pop();</span></li>
        <p>
            Copying an array to another array can be done with splice.
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">const newDiet = diet.splice();</span></li>
        <p>
            Looping through an array printing out every second letters for instance. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="code">for(let i = 1; i < lettersExpanded.length; i+=2){</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp;const everySecond = lettersExpanded[i];</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">}</span></li>
        <p>
            Looping through an array with if else statement. Simply by putting the if statement inside the loop.
            We talked shortly about just using for loops whenever you have something you can iterate through with a number
        </p>
        <h2 id="js-coercian">Type coercion</h2>
        <p>
            Javascript has type coercion. We can firstly use strict equality by using "===" or "!==" making sure we check for types
            aswell. If we use "==" or "!=" we do not check for types and type coercion would just make "1" == 1.
            Therefor we should always just make sure we have the correct types and use strict equality, otherwise we can get weird errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way to avoid this issue is typescript even though we have not talked about it. This makes sure you use the correct
            types as you have to declare types to everything, even going in and out of functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other ways to handle this could be if we are unsure on what we are recieving and it could be a number we could use Number(content)
            to make sure that we always have a number no matter what we are recieving. If it would not be able to be a number,
            then it would just be a NaN and we could easily see what error it is.
        </p>

        <h1>Node.js</h1>
        <h2 id="nodejs">Intro to node</h2>
        <p>
            Firstly for Node.js we installed it from https://nodejs.org.
            Some of us including me had worked with it before, so we already had it.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Node.js comes commands like:
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">node script.js</span></li>
        <p>
            With this we can run javascript files. This helps to check if things are working for smaller things. Likes calculations
            testing certain scenarios etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            We didn't use it for anything else during this week.

        <h1>Rest API</h1>
        <h2 id="conventions">Conventions</h2>
        <p>
            For REST we talk about about 3 conventions. 
        </p>
        <li>Use the appropriate HTTP method for the action.</li>
        <li>Correct ordering of the HTTP methods.</li>
        <li>Naming the endpoints so that they map to the collection in the system.</li>
        <h2 id="example">Example</h2>
        <p>
            Here's an example that gives a good overview:
