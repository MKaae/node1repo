        <h1>Git</h1>
        <h2 id="git-commands">Commands</h2>
        <li><span class="commands">git init</span></li>
        <p>
            This command is used to initiate git on a project. It does this by creating a .git in a sub directory.<br>
            You can only run this command if there isn't already a .git file. And be sure you're int the root of the directory you want
            to run this command on.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git add -A</span></li>
        <p>
            This command will stage all the changes in the entire repository where you're using it.<br>
            This will stage through the entire repository you're using in it, unlike ".", that just does it in the current directiory,
            and all directories below it. Resulting in -A being more effecient if you have changes across multiple directories.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git commit -m "message"</span></li>
        <p>
            When using this command we commit all the changes we have staged, and adds it to our local history as a new commit.<br>
            This means we can track our changes. Also the -m stands for message which is the message we add to the commit.<br>
            We want to have a clear message, a friend of mine told me "The action that it does", for instance,
            "adds eventlisteners to the homepage".
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git push origin main</span></li>
        <p>
            This pushes the changes to the main branch of the project that we have added to our git. "origin" is the name,
            that git has given the repository that we cloned from. "main" is the branch, and "push" is the command.
            This means we can also push to other remote branches like this. We did this alot in our "greenplate" project in 3rd semester. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git checkout -b branchname</span></li>
        <p>
            This command creates and checks us into the new branch that we just created. We haven't used it alot this semester,
            but we did use it the entirety of last semester during projects. "checkout" checks us into a branch, or you can say switches
            branches. "-b" is how you create a new branch.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git remote add origin githublinkToRepository</span></li>
        <p>
            This commands lets us add a remote to our repository. If we have already created a repository on github,
            and wants to add a connection to it, we can use this command. Github also provides us with this command after creating
            a new repository. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git branch -M main</span></li>
        <p>
           This renames the current branch to main. We use this before pushing to our github repository so we push with main branch,
           the first time we push our project.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git push -u origin main</span></li>
        <p>
            This pushing to our main to origin remote connection we made. We use -u to set up tracking so in the future we technically
            don't have to write git push origin main, because it will always push to main. But i personally find it good practice to do so,
            anwyays no matter where you are pushing to.
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git pull origin main</span></li>
        <p>
            This fetches the changes from the origin remote connection we have and adds them to our local git. For example if we make any changes
            online, or if someone else does if multiple is working on it. We can't just push to main branch unless we pull the current
            changes beforehand. 
        </p>
        <li><span class="commands">git status</span></li>
        <p>
            Shows the log and status of our git. This can be useful if you make a mistake and get behind / ahead of head to see what
            is going on and what you should do to fix this. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There is a few more commands we use but they are all situational so not listing them here, as i don't see it as a part of the assignment,
            but these are the most useful ones i use on a regular basis.
        </p>
